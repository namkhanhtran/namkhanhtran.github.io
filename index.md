As of September 2018 I've joined Amazon as an Applied Scientist.

I am interested in natural language processing, deep learning, and information retrieval.


Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](http://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at Saarland University, Germany and University of Trento, Italy. [Marco Baroni](https://marcobaroni.org/) and [Manfred Pinkal](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php) were my master thesis supervisors.
