I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Intelligent Cloud Control (ICC), with experience and knowledge in natural language processing, deep learning, information retrieval and time series forecasting.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](https://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at Universitaet des Saarlandes and Università degli Studi di Trento. [Marco Baroni](https://research.fb.com/people/baroni-marco/) and [Manfred Pinkal](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php) were my master thesis supervisors.
