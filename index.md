I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Intelligent Cloud Control (ICC), with experience and knowledge in natural language processing, deep learning, information retrieval and time series forecasting.

I did my PhD at L3S Research Center, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. During my PhD, I worked on natural language processing and information retrieval, advised by [Wolfgang Nejdl](http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/) and [Claudia Niederée](https://www.l3s.de/en/node/86).

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](https://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at Universität des Saarlandes and Università degli Studi di Trento. [Marco Baroni](https://research.fb.com/people/baroni-marco/) and [Manfred Pinkal](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php) were my master thesis supervisors.
