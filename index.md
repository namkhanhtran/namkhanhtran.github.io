I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Intelligent Cloud Control (ICC), with experience and knowledge in natural language processing, deep learning, and time series forecasting.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, EMLCT, in computational linguistics at Universit&at des Saarlandes and Università degli Studi di Trento. Marco Baroni and Manfred Pinkal were my master thesis supervisors.
