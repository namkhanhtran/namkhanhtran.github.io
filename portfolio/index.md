### Machine Learning Challenges

#### CIKM Cup 2016 Track 1: Cross-Device Entity Linking Challenge
I developed an ML approach to find the same user across multiple devices and build accurate user identity. My solution got the rank 5 among 300+ teams. My technical report can be found at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07117](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07117) and implementation [https://github.com/namkhanhtran/cikm-cup-2016-cross-device](https://github.com/namkhanhtran/cikm-cup-2016-cross-device)


#### ACM Recsys Challenge 2016
I developed a hybrid learning method, which combined content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, to predict job posting that a user will positively interactive with (e.g. click, bookmark). My implementation got the rank 30 among 109 teams.

### Projects

#### eLabour: Interdisciplinary centre for IT-based qualitative sociological research
The BMBF-funded Centre will focus on interdisciplinary methods in the novel area of secondary analysis of qualitative material and will foster their uptake.
_Contribution_: Implemented novel and tailored IT methods such as search and contextualization for sociological secondary analysis.

#### ForgetIT: Concise Preservation by Combining Managed Forgetting and Contextualized Remembering
ForgetIT is the large-scale EU project (total budget: &#8364; 9 million) that aims to develop the next-generation digital preservation framework with focus on personal and organisational settings.
_Contribution_: Proposed and implemented ML methods in the contextualization package, which bring context to object (text) to be preserved.

#### GuteArbeit: Exploring and Contextualizing Qualitative Data for Secondary Analysis
In social sciences, a tremendous body of data is being collected through observations and interviews. Given their long-standing research tradition, scientists are accumulating information about behavior, attitudes and beliefs at specific time frames-“realities” that cannot be captured later. “Gute Arbeit” enables intelligent access to such qualitative data gathered within diverse contexts through developing, adapting and advancing approaches from Information Retrieval and Data Mining.
_Contribution_: Proposed a method based on Latent Dirichlet allocation (i.e. Topic Cropping) and developed a prototype to support sociologists exploring qualitative studies.
